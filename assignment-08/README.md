  Affordances act as clues to how an object should be used. For example, text that simply says "submit" with no other features attached to it may not immediately cause the user to interact with it without thinking first. But if that text were surrounded by a rectangular blue background and were given some shading to imply it is a pressable button. The user is likely to assume without much thought that pressing that button will lead to an outcome.

  Though it may be easier to share and manage videos on platforms like YouTube, you loose some control over that content. If a video is hosted by you, the data is completely yours and not subject to any of another platform's terms and regulations. But using a third-party platform can be more intuitive and easy to use.
