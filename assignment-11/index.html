        Mark Maggiori (born June 16, 1977) is a French American painter. Maggiori began painting Western scenes in 2014. Since then, his works have been featured in Forbes, Flaunt, Art of the West, Southwest Art, Western Horseman and others. Maggiori has been noted in particular for the way he paints clouds in his landscape scenes, with Christopher Barker describing them as, "layered, textural monuments that both dwarf and magnify the subject with impossible detail."
