-Testing went well! Both users seemed to understand how i set up the navigation. They both really liked my design aspects of the cite, especially the color scheme and pictures I included.

-One of the big comments they had was to make more of my headshot visible on the home page. To alleviate this I made the center blue dot slightly smaller. After telling them the professional documents section was still being developed, they suggested I make my documents downloadable. I haven't been able to include this yet but am definitely working on it!
